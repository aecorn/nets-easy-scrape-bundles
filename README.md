# nets-easy-scrape-bundles
There is currently no way of getting a properly formatted spreadsheet export of the bundles from NETS EASY. If they implement that feature, this scraping script will be obsolete.

Written as Jupyter Notebook in Python 3, using Anaconda Navigator.
Uses Beautiful Soup 4 and Selenium heavily.
