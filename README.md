# Scrape Nets Easy for transaction-bundle data
There is currently no way of getting a properly formatted spreadsheet export of the bundles from NETS EASY. If they implement that feature, this scraping script will be obsolete.

Written as Jupyter Notebook in Python 3, using Anaconda Navigator on a mac.
Uses Beautiful Soup 4 and Selenium heavily.

Be warned that some Norwegian may occur.
